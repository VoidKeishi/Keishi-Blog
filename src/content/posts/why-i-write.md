I didn't grow up wanting to be a writer. I grew up wanting to understand things. Code, systems, how the world works. Writing was just a way to explain what I'd figured out.

But somewhere along the way, I realized something: **writing isn't just how I explain thinking. Writing *is* thinking.**

## Writing as Thinking

When an idea lives only in your head, it can hide. It can be vague. It can pretend to be coherent while actually being a mess of half-formed intuitions.

Writing forces clarity. You can't write a sentence that means nothing (well, you can, but it's obvious). You can't hide behind the feeling that you understand something—you have to actually demonstrate understanding.

I've lost count of how many times I've sat down to write about something I thought I understood, only to realize halfway through that I didn't understand it at all. The writing revealed the gaps.

> "I write because I don't know what I think until I read what I say." — Flannery O'Connor

## The Idea Debt Problem

Ideas are like debt. When you have an idea and don't develop it, it sits in your mind taking up space. It nags at you. It prevents other ideas from fully forming.

Writing is how I pay off idea debt.

When I write something down—even if no one reads it—the idea becomes external. It's no longer something I need to carry around. I can move on to the next thing.

This blog exists partly as a dumping ground. A place where ideas can go to live outside my head.

## Public Thinking

But if writing is just for thinking, why publish? Why not keep everything in private notes?

Two reasons:

**First, public stakes improve quality.** When I know someone might read what I write, I think harder about it. I check my claims. I consider counterarguments. The fear of being wrong in public is a powerful motivator for being right.

**Second, writing is communication.** If I write something useful and keep it private, only one person benefits. If I publish it, maybe it helps someone else. Maybe someone smarter than me points out where I'm wrong. Either way, more value is created.

## What to Expect

This blog will be a mix of topics:

- **Technology** — what I'm building, what I'm learning, what I think about the industry
- **Systems thinking** — how to think about complex problems, mental models that work
- **Life** — personal essays, philosophy, the messy business of being human

I'll try to write clearly and directly. No fluff, no buzzwords. If I don't have something to say, I won't say it.

Let's see where this goes.
